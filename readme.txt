--Readme document for Eren Nova Kim, erennk@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
1. I included at least one image with descriptive alt text
2. I included appropiate headings and paragraph text
3. I used semantic HTML tag(s) (footer)
4. I used links to external page(s)
5. I included multiple pages, with appropriate navigation between them



(b) CSS features
1. I modified padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
2. I modified link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing
3. I added custom font(s) from Google fonts to add more personality (make sure to include appropriate fallbacks)



(c) Advanced features
1. I created a more complex page layout (included a navigation bar)
2. I used the object tag to embed a PDF reader




3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
There were no Errors, only "Potential Problems". I ignored them for 1.1 (Text Alternatives) and 1.4 (Distinguishable), which accounts for 6 checks, because the warnings were about the alt text possibly being inaccurate and the image being decorate and/or having 
content that may confuse a screen reader. I ignored this because the alt text was concise and I felt that it summarized the picture, since the picture was not very complicated. Also, it does not contain text thaat would confuse a screen reader.
I also ignored 1.3 (Adaptable) and 2.4 (Navigable), which accounts for 11 checks, because they ahd to do with marking list items, which I did,and heading usage (which I chose in order in a way that made sense, not just for formatting).
I also ingored 3.1 (Readable) and 3.2 (Predictable), which accounts for 4 checks, because they said I could have used blockquote only for indention, which I did not, and that the nav bar may be inconsistent between pages, which it is not. The warnings were
the same for both html accessibility checks.



4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
8 hours



5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I consulted Jullianna Lin for help with understanding CSS units (px vs % vs rem)



7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
When I click the W3C Validator link the base code provided in the footer, I get a W3C page that says "Sorry! This document cannot be checked."
The validator works when I upload my files directly and the error says "This is not an error in the referring page!"
